# fx-volatility-trading
The implementation of an FX Volatility Trading Model Using ML

## Description
This is a case study for SpinUp's recruiting process. Due to timing issues, only a prototype has been implemented. I would be more than happy to discuss how it would be implemented in a production environment. Nonetheless, the code shows different styles of implementation, from figurative object-oriented and mid-level array maniulation (proper of production environments), to jupyter notebook algorithm prototyping.

## Getting started
Simply run the following to clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/CarPobl/fx-volatility-trading.git```

Install relevant packages:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Jupyter
The prototype for the algorithm has been described in a jupyter notebook. To execute, runthefollowing
```pip install jupyterlab```
Then on the root directory run
```jupyter lab```

## Testing
To run unittests, simply run:
```pytest .```
