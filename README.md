# fx-volatility-trading
The implementation of an FX Volatility Trading Model Using ML

## Description
This a case study for SpinUp's recruiting process. Due to timing issues, the implemented code in this repository is not complete. The code is only compatible with python 3.6+ and contains a jupyter notebook that can be run to visualise the results. Alternatively, the same code is available in a regular python file.

## Getting started
Simply run the following to clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/CarPobl/fx-volatility-trading.git```

Install relevant packages:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Jupyter
The prototype for the algorithm has been described in a jupyter notebook. To execute, runthefollowing
```pip install jupyterlab```
Then on the root directory run
```jupyter lab```

## Testing
To run unittests, simply run:
```pytest .```
